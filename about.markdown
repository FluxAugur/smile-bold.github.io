# Welcome to my developer journey!
I've worked with languages such as Javascript, C++, C-sharp, and Swift. Javascript ES6 code ingenunity adds some many cool features to innovate and replicate code between files. C-sharp is a **clean**, compact language in my opinion while c++ is the original **OG** of the coding languages with the most power behind it. Swift is the trickiest language to learn with its constantly updated and **improved** syntax.
